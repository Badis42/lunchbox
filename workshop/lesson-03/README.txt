# lesson-03 Ansible configuration file

# MOTTO: define parameters in ansible.cfg, for your commands to be short.
Use the file 'ansible.cfg' to set parameters that affect running ansible, and ansible-playbook. This file can be present in the project directory, your home directory, or /etc/ansible.cfg. 

# TODO 1. Copy the file 'ansible.cfg' to the project directory.
# TODO 2. In lesson 9 you need to change the value of ask_vault_pass to True.
